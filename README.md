# BSc Thesis project: "Implementation of autoregressive language model for human-AI interaction using Alexa virtual assistant technology"




In light of the latest developments in new algorithms  State-Of-The-Art in the Natural Language Processing field as GPT-3, LaMDa, and BLOOM, the study aims to create a socialbot using a model of artificial intelligence type autoregressive language model and then implement it on Voice User Interface (VUI) Alexa platform.

Among the models mentioned above in the paper, the model used is the artificial intelligence BigScience Large Open-science Open-access Multilingual Language Model called BLOOM developed by BigScience and HuggingFace.

Version 1.0 of the socialbot asks the BLOOM Model, through the Hugging Face API, about a possible topic requested by the user receiving input through any device with Alexa embedded.

Then the answer is received and read by Alexa.

The code is hosted entirely in the cloud on the AWS environment using services external to Alexa such as AWS Lambda and AWS LEX.

In future developments, additional functions will be added to the social bot in order to make it able to have a conversation with the user according to the same dynamics of a conversation between people.
